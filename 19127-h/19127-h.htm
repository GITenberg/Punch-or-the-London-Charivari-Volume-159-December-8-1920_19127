<h1>PUNCH,<br />OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.</h1>
<h2>Vol. 159.</h2>
<hr class="full" />

<h2>December 8th, 1920.</h2>
<hr class="full" />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page441" id="page441"></a>[pg 441]</span>
<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Lord Riddell</span>, in giving his impression
of President <span class="sc">Wilson</span>, says that his
trousers and boots were not in keeping
with the smartness of his appearance
above the table. This is where the
trained habits of journalistic observation
come in.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In answer to many inquiries we are
unable to obtain confirmation of a
rumour that Mr. <span class="sc">Charlie Chaplin's</span>
contemplated retirement is connected
with an invitation from Mr. <span class="sc">Horatio
Bottomley</span> to enter the arena of British
politics.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>According to an evening paper the
lady who has just become Duchess of
Westminster has "one son,
a boy." On the other hand
the <span class="sc">Duke</span> himself has two
daughters, both girls.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Over two million Chinese
pigtails have been imported
into the United States,
where they will be used for
straining soup, declares a
Washington correspondent.
The wartime curtailment
of the moustache, it
appears, has done away
with the old custom of
straining the soup after
it comes to table.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A police magistrate of
Louisville, Kentucky, has
been called upon to decide
whether a man may marry
his divorced wife's mother.
In our view the real question
is whether, with a
view to securing the sanctity of the
marriage tie, it should not be made
compulsory.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"This morning," says a recent issue
of a Dublin paper, "police visited
<i>Young Ireland</i> office and placed arretssssshrrr
rr rr r h bfad mb shs under
arrest." Suspicion was apparently
aroused by his giving his name in the
Erse tongue.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Enormous damage, says a cable, has
been done by a water-spout which struck
Tangier, Morocco, on Saturday. We
note with satisfaction, on the other
hand, that the water-spout which recently
struck Scotland had no ill effects.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Every hotel in London taken over by
the Government has now been given up.
The idea of keeping one as a memento
was suggested, but Sir <span class="sc">Alfred Mond</span>
decided to throw in his hand.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Asked his profession last week a man
is reported to have answered, "<i>Daily
Mail</i> Reader."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>While a fire was being extinguished
at Boston, Mass., recently the hose
burst into flames. A country where
that sort of thing occurs can afford to
take Prohibition lying down.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A Constantinople message states that
a Turk named <span class="sc">Zorn Mehmed</span> is one
hundred and forty-six years of age.
This is said to be due to the fact that
for the last century or so he has kept a
pet thyroid which he takes about on a
chain.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We have no wish to cast any reflection
on the courage of the Prohibitionists,
but we can draw our own conclusions
from the fact that we haven't
noticed them rushing to Ireland.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A Denver newspaper points out that
the "Wild West bandit" has died out.
Our own impression was that he had
got a job as a waiter in London.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Things are settling down in America.
A news report states that <span class="sc">Willard
Mack</span>, the actor, has only been divorced
three times.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"We have an innate modesty about
advertising ourselves," said Sir <span class="sc">Robert
Horne</span> at the International Advertising
Exhibition. A certain colleague of his
in the Ministry is reported to have said
that Sir <span class="sc">Robert</span> can speak for himself
in future.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We understand that the idea of producing
a filmed version of Mrs. <span class="sc">Asquith's</span>
Diary has been shelved for the present,
owing to the difficulty of procuring
actors for the more dangerously acrobatic
incidents.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>An old lady writes to us with reference
to wild-cat taxation that she has
always advocated it, but that she has
understood that the difficulty was to
determine the ownership of these unfortunate
vagrants.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The new houses when ready, says a
North of England Town Clerk, will only
be let to those people who are married.
We have felt all along that there was
some catch about Dr. <span class="sc">Addison's</span> housing
scheme.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>To a discreditable alien source has
been traced the scandalous
rumour that the disappearance
of the summit of Mont
Blanc is due to certain
admirers of Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd
George</span>, who wished to
present their hero with
something in the nature
of a permanent peroration.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>As a partial remedy for
the overcrowding at Oxford,
it is suggested that
the University should
come into line with Battersea
by making a rule
that lost causes will not be
kept longer than three days
before being destroyed.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"I was the anonymous
person who walked down
Harley Street and counted
the number of open windows,"
confesses Sir <span class="sc">St.
Clair Thomson</span>, M.D. So now we can
concentrate on <span class="sc">Junius</span> and the Man in
the Iron Mask.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Motorists are becoming much more
polite, we read. They now catch pedestrians
sideways, instead of full on.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>According to an official of the
R.S.P.C.A., as <i>Punch</i> informed us last
week, dogs do not possess suicidal
tendencies. Yet the other day we saw
an over-fed poodle deliberately loitering
outside a sausage factory.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"The number of curates who seem
to be able to find plenty of time for
golf is most surprising," writes a correspondent.
We suppose the majority
of them employ vicars.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Spanish toreadors are on strike for a
higher wage. There is talk, we understand,
of a six bull week.</p>

<h4>THE DARK AGES.</h4>

<h4>(<i>Being reflections on the pre-press period.</i>)</h4>

<blockquote><p>
[In <i>The Times</i> of December 2nd Lord <span class="sc">Northcliffe</span> traces the
history of the English Press from the appearance of the first newspaper
uttered in English&mdash;"A Corrant out of Germany," imprinted
at Amsterdam, December 2nd, 1620&mdash;and finds some difficulty in
understanding how civilisation got on as well as it did through all
those preceding centuries.]
</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>To-day (December 2) we keep, with cheers,</p>
<p class="i2">The Tercentenary of the Press!</p>
<p>Probing the darkness of the previous years</p>
<p class="i2">I try, but try in vain, to guess</p>
<p>How anybody lived before the birth</p>
<p>Of this the Very Greatest Thing on Earth.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>You'd say it must have been a savage life.</p>
<p class="i2">Men were content to eat and drink</p>
<p>And spend the intervals in carnal strife</p>
<p class="i2">With none to teach them how to think;</p>
<p>They had no Vision and their minds were dense,</p>
<p>Largely for lack of True "Intelligence."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>When a volcano burst or floods occurred</p>
<p class="i2">No correspondent flashed the news;</p>
<p>It came by rumour or a little bird,</p>
<p class="i2">Devoid of editorial views;</p>
<p>No leader let them know to what extent</p>
<p>The blame should lie upon the Government.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And yet, when no one knew in those dumb days</p>
<p class="i2">Exactly what was going on,</p>
<p>Without reporters they contrived to raise</p>
<p class="i2">The Pyramids and Parthenon;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Confucius</span> preached the Truth, and so did <span class="sc">Paul</span>,</p>
<p>Though neither of them got in print at all.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>It sounds incredible that, when in Greece</p>
<p class="i2">The poets sang to lyre or pipe,</p>
<p>When <span class="sc">Homer</span> (say) threw off his little piece,</p>
<p class="i2">Nobody put the thing in type;</p>
<p>Even in days less barbarously rude</p>
<p><span class="sc">Virgil</span>, it seems, was never interviewed.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And how did <span class="sc">Dante</span> manage to indite</p>
<p class="i2">His admirable tale of Hell,</p>
<p>Or <span class="sc">Buonarroti</span> sculp his sombre "Night"</p>
<p class="i2">Without the kodak's magic spell&mdash;</p>
<p>No Press-photographer, a dream of tact,</p>
<p>To snap the artist in the very act?</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Poor primitives, who groped amid the gloom</p>
<p class="i2">And perished ere the dawn of day,</p>
<p>Ere yet Publicity, with piercing boom,</p>
<p class="i2">Had shown the world a better way;</p>
<p>Before the age&mdash;so good for him that climbs&mdash;</p>
<p>Now culminating in the <span class="sc">Northcliffe</span> times.</p>

<h3>OUR LUCKY DIPPERS.</h3>

<p>Further and final particulars of the drawings from the
Lucky Bag at the Purple City are replete with illustrations
of the extraordinary congruity between the prizes and
the age, sex and station of the recipients.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sarah Boakes, who received the colossal equestrian
bronze statue of Lord <span class="sc">Thanet</span>, weighing three hundred tons
and valued at five thousand guineas, told our representative
that the idea of getting one of the big prizes never entered
into her head, and added, "I did not sleep a wink last
night; the statue was in my mind the whole time." Mrs.
Boakes, an attractive elderly lady of some seventy-five
summers, is engaged at a laundry at East Putney. The
haulage of the statue to her home at 129, Arabella Road,
S.W. 15, is likely to be a costly affair; but Mrs. Boakes has
made an application for a grant-in-aid to the Ministry of
Health and has received a sympathetic reply from Dr.
<span class="sc">Addison</span>. The cost of reconstructing her house to enable
the statue to be set up in her parlour is estimated at about
£4,500.</p>

<p>Mr. Jolyon Forsyth, who won the African elephant, is
a stoker on the South Western Railway and lives at Worplesdon.
He applied to the Company for a day's leave in
order to ride his prize home; but his request was most
unwarrantably refused, and the matter is receiving the
earnest attention of the N.U.R. Mr. Forsyth informed our
representative that his wife keeps a small poultry run, and
hopes that she will be able to make room for the new visitor
without seriously incommoding her fowls. Failing that, he
thinks that employment may be found for the elephant on
the Worplesdon Links, either in rolling the greens or
irrigating them with its trunk. The claims of the animal
to an unemployment allowance are being considered by
Dr. <span class="sc">Macnamara</span>.</p>

<p>Gladys Gilkes, a bright-eyed child of six, living with her
parents at 345, Beaverbrook Avenue, Harringay, who received
a Sandringham opera-hat, is enduring her felicity
with fortitude. "I have never been to the opera yet," she
naïvely remarked to our representative, "but my brother
Bert plays beautifully on the concertina."</p>

<p>Great interest has been excited in the neighbourhood of
Tulse Hill by the success of Mr. Enoch Pegler, the winner of
the three-manual electric cathedral organ with sixty-four
stops, the most sonorous instrument of its type yet constructed
by Messrs. Waghorn and Fogg, the famous organ-builders
of Penge. A special piquancy is lent to the episode
by the fact that Mr. Pegler, who is seventy-nine years of age
and has long been a martyr to rheumatoid arthritis in both
hands, belongs to the sect of the Silentiary Tolstoyans,
who discountenance all music, whether sacred or profane.
Mr. Pegler, it should be explained, authorised his grandniece,
Miss Hester Wigglesworth, to put in for the Lucky Bag
in his name, but, on the advice of the family physician, Dr.
Parry Gorwick, the result has not yet been broken to him.
Meanwhile, thanks to the tactful intervention of Sir <span class="sc">Eric
Geddes</span>, the instrument has been temporarily housed in the
Zoological Gardens, where daily recitals are given at meal-times
by Dr. <span class="sc">Chalmers Mitchell</span> and other powerful executants.
Unfortunately the organ was not yet installed at
the time of the recent encounter between a lion and a tigress,
otherwise the fatality would, in the opinion of Sir <span class="sc">Frederick
Bridge</span>, have almost certainly been avoided.</p>

<h3>UNAUTHENTIC IMPRESSIONS.</h3>

<h4>V.&mdash;<span class="sc1">The Sizzles.</span></h4>

<p>I cannot help it, but this article has
got to begin with a short historical
disquisition. Many people are puzzled
to know why Lord <span class="sc">Hugh Cecil</span> wears
that worried look, and why Lord <span class="sc">Robert</span>
also looks so sad. Yet the explanation
is simple enough. It is because nobody
can pronounce their surname. "Cessil,"
says the man in the street (and being
in a street is a thing that may happen
to anybody) as he sees the gaunt careworn
figures going by. And when they
hear it the sensitive ear of the <span class="sc">Cecils</span>
is wrung with torture at the sound.
They wince. They would like to buttonhole
the man in the street and explain
to him, like the <i>Ancient Mariner</i>, all
about David Cyssell, the founder of
their line. David Cyssell, it seems,
though he didn't quite catch the Norman
Conquest and missed the Crusades,
and was a little bit late for the Wars
of the Roses, was nicely in time to get
a place in the train of <span class="sc">Henry</span> VIII.,
which was quite early enough for a
young man who firmly intended to be
an ancestor. When he died his last
words were, "Rule England, my boys,
but never never, never let the people
call you 'Cessil,'" and his sons obeyed
him dutifully by becoming Earls and
Marquises and all that kind of thing,
so that the trouble did not arise.</p>

<p>But, of course, if you don't happen
to be the eldest son, the danger is still
there. And it is this danger which has
led Lord <span class="sc">Hugh Cecil</span> to withdraw
himself more and more into the company
of ecclesiastical dignitaries, who
are accustomed to pronounce quite hard
words, like <i>chrysoprasus</i> and <i>Abednego</i>
without turning a hair, if they have one,
and Lord <span class="sc">Robert Cecil</span> to confine his
attention to the League of Nations,
where all the people are foreigners and
much too ignorant to pronounce any
English name at all.</p>

<p>Personally I hold that, if it were not
for this trouble about hearing their name
said all wrong by people on omnibuses
and even shouted all wrong by newspaper
sellers, one of the <span class="sc">Cecils</span> might
become Prime Minister some day. As
it is they wear a look of sorrowful
martyrdom, as if they were perfectly
ready for the nearest stake; and this
look, combined with their peculiar surname,
has caused them to be not in-aptly
known as <i>The Sizzles</i>. How very
much better would it have been, my
dear reader, if their great ancestor had
been simply called "David," so that
they could have had a sunny smile and
not so many convictions.</p>

<p>It is customary in speaking of the
Sizzles to include some mention of their
more famous relative, Mr. <span class="sc">Arthur Balfour</span>.
Very well, then.</p>

<h4><i><span class="sc1">Mr. Arthur Balfour</span></i>.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Born in 1873 the future Vice-President
of the Sheffield Chamber of Commerce,
Master Cutler and Chairman of
the High-Speed Alloys Company, Limited,
Widnes&mdash;&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>[<i>Editor.</i> What the deuce are you
talking about?</p>

<p><i>Author.</i> I like that. It comes straight
out of <i>What's Which?</i></p>

<p><i>Editor.</i> Well, you must have got the
wrong page.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page445" id="page445"></a>[pg 445]</span>

<p><i>Author</i>. Why, you don't mean to say
there are two <span class="sc">Arthur Balfours</span>, do
you?</p>

<p><i>Editor</i>. I do.</p>

<p><i>Author</i>. Aren't you thinking of the
two <span class="sc">Winston Churchills</span>?</p>

<p><i>Editor</i>. No, I'm not.</p>

<p><i>Author</i>. Well, perhaps I'd better
begin again.</p>

<h4><i><span class="sc1">Mr. Arthur Balfour</span></i>.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Born, as one might say, with a silver
niblick in his mouth and possessed of
phenomenal intellectual attainments,
Mr. <span class="sc">Arthur Balfour</span> (the one on the
other page) was not long in settling
down to his main life-work, which has
been the laying out of University golf
curricula.</p></blockquote>

<p>[Is that better?&mdash;<i>Editor</i>. Much.]</p>

<p>In spite of this preoccupation he
has found time for a remarkable number
of hobbies, such as politics, music
and the study of refrigerating machines,
though the effect of all these various
activities is sometimes a little confusing
for those with whom he works. When
consulted on a burning topic of the
hour he may, for instance, be on the
point of inventing a new type of ice-bucket,
so that the interviewer is forced
to go out quickly and fetch his fur
overcoat before he can talk in comfort.
Or he may be playing, like <i>Sherlock
Holmes</i>, on his violin, and say, "Just
wait till I've finished this sonata."
And by the time it's finished the
bother about Persia or Free Trade is
quite forgotten. Or, again, Mr. <span class="sc">Balfour</span>
may be closeted with Professor
<span class="sc">Vardon</span>, Doctor <span class="sc">Ray</span> or Vice-Chancellor
<span class="sc">Mitchell</span> at the very moment when
the Nicaraguan envoy is clamouring at
the door.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that Mr. <span class="sc">Arthur
Balfour</span> has sometimes been called
Mr. Arthur Baffler. Puzzling, however,
though he may be in many of his political
manifestations, his writings are
like a beacon in the gloom, and some
day these simple chatty little booklets
will surely gain the wide public which
they deserve. "The Foundation of
Bunkers," "A Defence of Philosophic
Divots" and "Wood-wind and Brassies"
should be read by all who are
interested in <i>belles lettres</i>. And his
latest volume of essays deals, I believe,
with subjects so widely diverse and yet
so enthralling as "Booty and the Criticism
of Booty," "Trotsky's View of
Russian World Policy," "Quizzical Research"
and "The Freedom of the Tees."</p>

<p>The real pity is that with all his
many and wonderful gifts Mr. <span class="sc">Arthur
Balfour</span> has never felt the fiery enthusiasm
of his Hatfield cousins. He remains,
in fact, a salamander among
the Sizzles.</p>

<h3>PRISCILLA PLAYS FAIRIES.</h3>

<p>Unrehearsed dramatic dialogue
comes quite easily to some people, and
so does a knowledge of the ways of the
fairy world, but I am not one of those
people. Also I was supposed to have
a headache that afternoon and to be
recovering from a severe cold. Also I
was reading a very exciting book. I
cannot help thinking therefore that the
fairy Bluebell was taking a mean advantage
of my numerous disabilities in
appearing at all. She rattled the handle
of the door a long time, and when I had
opened it came in by a series of little
skips on her toes, accompanied by wagglings
of the arms rather in the fashion
of a penguin. Every now and then she
gave a slightly higher
jump and descended
flatly and rather noisily
on her feet. She wore
a new frock, with frills.</p>

<p><i>I.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;What are you
doing, Priscilla?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I'm the Fairy
Bluebell dancing.
Don't you like my
dancing?</p>

<p><i>I.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;It's beautiful.</p>

<p><i>She</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>rapidly</i>). And
you were a very poor
old man who had a lot
of nasty work to do and
you were asleep.</p>

<p><i>I</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>feeling it might
have been much worse
and composing myself
to slumber in my chair</i>).
Honk!</p>

<p><i>She</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>pinching my ear
and pulling it very hard</i>).
And you woke up and
said, "I do believe
there's a dear little
fairy dancing."</p>

<p><i>I</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>emerging from repose</i>). Why, I do
believe I heard a fairy dancing, or (<i>vindictively</i>)
can it have been another ton
of coal coming in?</p>

<p><i>She</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>disregarding my malice</i>). And
you said, "Alack, alack! I do want
somefing to eat."</p>

<p><i>I.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Alack, alack! I <i>am</i> so hungry.</p>

<p><i>She</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>fetching a large cushion from the
sofa and putting it on the top of me</i>).
Lumpetty, lumpetty, lumpetty.</p>

<p><i>I.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;What's that, Priscilla?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Bitatoes pouring out of a sack.
(<i>Fetches another cushion and puts it on
the top of the first.</i>) Lumpetty, lumpetty,
lumpetty.</p>

<p><i>I.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;And this?</p>

<p><i>She</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>opening her eyes very wide</i>).
Red plums. (<i>Fetches another cushion.</i>)
Limpetty, limpetty, limpetty.</p>

<p><i>I.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;What's that?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Lovely honey.</p>

<p><i>I</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>affecting to simulate the natural
gratification of a poor old man suddenly
smothered in vegetables, fruit and liquid
preserve</i>). How perfectly delicious!</p>

<p><i>She.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;And you want to go to sleep
again. [<i>I go.</i></p>

<p><i>She</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>pulling my ear again</i>). And you
sawed a dragon coming up the drive,
and the sofa was the dragon.</p>

<p><i>I.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Alack, alack! I see a dragon
coming up the drive. What shall I do?
I must telephone to the police.</p>

<p><i>She</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>quickly</i>). Did the police have a
tuncheon?</p>

<p><i>I.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, he did.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Shall I be the police?</p>

<p><i>I</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>cautiously, because a "tuncheon"
necessitates making a long paper roll out
of "The Times"</i>). I am afraid the telephone
had broken down, so the police
didn't hear. How I wish the Fairy
Bluebell was about!</p>

<p><i>She.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;And so the Fairy Bluebell came
and cut off the dragon's head and gave
it to you.</p>

<p>[<i>Fetches a fourth large cushion and
adds it to the pile.</i></p>

<p><i>I.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;But why should I have the
dragon's head?</p>

<p><i>She</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>enigmatically</i>). You had to have
it.</p>

<p>[<i>The poor old man resigns himself
to his increasingly glutinous fate.</i></p>

<p><i>She</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>fetching a waste-paper basket
and returning to the sofa</i>). Limpetty,
limpetty, limpetty.</p>

<p><i>I</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>faint but inquisitive</i>). Whatever
are you doing now, Priscilla?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Poisoning the dragon's body.</p>

<p><i>I.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Poisoning it?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, wiv a can.</p>

<p><i>I.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;How?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Down its neck.</p>

<p><i>I</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>feeling that the immediate peril
from the dragon's assault is now practically
over and wishing to return the
fairy's kindness</i>). Shall we pretend that
the sofa is where the Fairy Bluebell
lived, and I built her a little home with
flowers, and these cushions were the
flowers, and (<i>rather basely</i>) she went
to sleep in it?</p>

<p><i>She</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>with sparkling eyes</i>). Yes, yes.</p>

<p>[<i>I remove the potatoes, the plums,
the honey and the head of the
dragon and manufacture a grotto
in which the Fairy Bluebell reclines
with closed eyes. It appears
to be a suitable moment for
returning to my book.</i></p>

<p><i>She.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;And suddenly the Fairy Bluebell
woke up, and what
do you think she
wanted?</p>

<p><i>I</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>disillusioned</i>). I
can't think.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;She wanted to
be readen to.</p>

<p><i>I</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>resignedly</i>). And
what did I do?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You said, "I'll
read about Tom and the
otter."</p>

<p><i>I</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>hopefully</i>). I don't
know where it is.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I think it's in the
dining-room, and the
Fairy Bluebell couldn't
get it herself because
she was only a <i>little</i> girl
really.</p>

<p>As I say, there are a
lot of people, and many
of them, doubtless,
readers of this paper,
who understand all
about fairies. I want to
ask them, as one poor old
hard-worked man to another, whether
this is the proper way for a fairy to
behave. There seems to be a lack of
delicacy&mdash;and shall I say shyness?&mdash;about
it.</p>

<h3>THE WHITE SPAT.</h3>

<p>When it is remembered how large a
part has been played in history by
revolutionary and political songs it is
both lamentable and strange that at
the present time only one of the numerous
political faiths has a hymn of its
own&mdash;"The Red Flag." The author
of the words owes a good deal, I should
say, to the author of "Rule Britannia,"
though I am inclined to think he has
gone one better. The tune is that
gentle old tune which we used to know
as "Maryland," and by itself it rather
suggests a number of tired sheep waiting
to go through a gate than a lot
of people thinking very redly. I fancy
the author realised this, and he has got
over it by putting in some good powerful
words like "scarlet," "traitors,"
"flinch" and "dungeon," whenever
the tune is particularly sheepish. The
effect is effective. Just imagine if the
Middle Classes Union could march
down the middle of the Strand singing
that fine chorus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Then raise the scarlet standard high,</p>
<p>Beneath its shade we'll live and die;</p>
<p>Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer</p>
<p>We'll keep the Red Flag flying here."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Well, I have set myself to supply
some of the other parties with songs,
and I have begun with "The White
Spat," which is to be the party-hymn
of the High Tories (if any). I have
written it to the same tune as "The Red
Flag," because, when the lion finally
does lie down with the lamb, it will
be much more convenient if they can
bleat and roar in the same metre, and
I shall hope to hear Mr. <span class="sc">Robert
Williams</span> and Lord <span class="sc">Robert Cecil</span>
singing these two songs at once one
day. I am not wholly satisfied with
"The White Spat," but I think I have
caught the true spirit, or, at any
rate, the proper inconsequence of these
things:&mdash;</p>

<h4><span class="sc"><b>The White Spat</b></span></h4>

<h4>Air&mdash;<i>Maryland</i>.</h4>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>The spats we wear are pure as snow&mdash;</p>
<p>We are so careful where we go;</p>
<p>We don't go near the vulgar bus</p>
<p>Because it always splashes us.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Chorus.</i></p>
<p>We take the road with trustful hearts,</p>
<p>Avoiding all the messy parts;</p>
<p>However dirty you may get</p>
<p>We'll keep the White Spat spotless yet.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>At night there shines a special star</p>
<p>To show us where the puddles are;</p>
<p>The crossing-sweeper sweeps the floor&mdash;</p>
<p>That's what the crossing-sweeper's for.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Chorus.</i></p>
<p>Then take the road, etc., etc.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>I know it doesn't look much, just
written down on paper; but you try
singing it and you'll find you're carried
away.</p>

<p>Of course there ought to be an international
verse, but I'm afraid I can't
compete with the one in my model:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Look round: the Frenchman loves its blaze,</p>
<p>The sturdy German chants its praise;</p>
<p>In Moscow's vaults its hymns are sung;</p>
<p>Chicago swells the surging throng."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>This is the best I can do:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>From Russia's snows to Afric's sun</p>
<p>The race of spatriots is one;</p>
<p>One faith unites their alien blood&mdash;</p>
<p>"There's nothing to be said for mud."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Now we have the song of the Wee
Frees. I wanted this to be rather pathetic,
but I'm not sure that I haven't
overdone it. The symbolism, though,
is well-nigh perfect, and, after all, the
symbolism is the chief thing. This goes
to the tune of "Annie Laurie":&mdash;</p>

<h4><span class="sc"><b>The Old Black Brolly.</b></span></h4>

<h4>Air&mdash;<i>Annie Laurie</i>.</h4>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Under the Old Umbrella,</p>
<p class="i2">Beneath the leaking gamp,</p>
<p>Wrapped up in woolly phrases</p>
<p class="i2">We battle with the damp.</p>
<p class="i2">Come, gather round the gamp!</p>
<p>Observe, it is pre-war;</p>
<p class="i2">And beneath the old Black Brolly</p>

<p>To show we're not quite dead,</p>
<p class="i2">We wave the old Black Brolly</p>
<p>And hit them on the head.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Then we have the National Party.
I am rather vague about the National
Party, but I know they are frightfully
military, and they keep on having Mass
Rallies in Kensington&mdash;complete with
drums, I expect. Where all the masses
come from I don't quite know, as a
prolonged search has failed to reveal
anyone who knows anyone who is
actually a member of the party. Everybody
tells me, though, that there is at
least one Brigadier-General (Tempy.)
mixed up with it, if not two, and at
least one Lord, though possibly one of
the Brigadiers is the same as the Lord;
but after all they represent the Nation,
so they ought to have a song. They
have nothing but "Rule Britannia"
now, I suppose.</p>

<p>Their song goes to the tune of "The
British Grenadiers." I have written it
as a duet, but no doubt other parts
could be added if the occasion should
ever arise.</p>

<p>Some talk of Coalitions,</p>

<p>There could be a great deal more of

<p>Of course, if you don't think the

  </div>  </div>

<p>If people can get excited singing that,
my songs would send them crazy.</p>

<p>Then there is the Coalition. I have
had a good deal of difficulty about this,

<p>Once again, merely written down,
the words do <i>not</i> thrill, but I hope none
of the parties will definitely reject these
hymns till they have heard them actually
sung; if necessary I will give a

<p>The other day, when we were playing
charades and had to act L, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page449" id="page449"></a>[pg 449]</span>
did <i>Lloyd George and the Coalition</i>;
and the people who were acting the
Coalition sang the above song with
really wonderful effect. It is true that
the other side thought we were acting
<i>Legion and the Gadarene Swine</i>, but
that must have been because of something
faulty in our make-up. The sound
of this great anthem was sufficiently
impressive to make one long to hear
the real Coalition shouting it all along
Downing Street. It is a solo with
chorus, you understand, and the Coalition
come in with a great roar of excitement
and fervour on <i>Doo-dah! Doo-dah!</i></p>

<p>Yes, I like that.</p>

<h3>QUESTIONS.</h3>

<p>How did mankind get to all corners
of the earth? and what is the cause of
exploding suns? These are among the
questions put by Professor A. W. <span class="sc">Bickerton</span>,
of the London Astronomical
Society, and they would be solved, it
seems, if our learned men would only
band themselves together. I have no
wish to hamper the good work, but a
moment's reflection suggests a number
of other questions simply asking to be
answered.</p>

<p>For instance, what happens when an
irresistible force meets Sir <span class="sc">Eric Geddes</span>?</p>

<p>And why is it that while we hear of
thousands of people losing their umbrellas
we have never yet heard of a
single case where a man openly admitted
that he had found one?</p>

<p>And is there any reason why the
modern novel should not end happily,
instead of the hero and heroine always
marrying at the last moment.</p>

<p>And how does it happen that Thanet
is the best holiday-place in this country
and enjoys more sunshine than any
other resort?</p>

<p>And could not <i>The Daily Mail</i> extend
the same sunshine privilege to
other parts?</p>

<p>And what makes a music-hall audience
laugh when a comedian changes
his hat and mutters the mystic word,
"Winston"?</p>

<p>And who is the gentleman referred to?</p>

<p>And why is it that nine-tenths of the
coon-singers on the halls are always
wanting to get back to their dear old
homes? And who is stopping them in
their noble desire? And is there any
explanation why all these singers seem
to have their homes in distant Alabam,
where the roses keep on climbing round
the door, just close to where the cotton
and the corn are growing all the year
round, only later in life to leave the dear
old place to take up music-hall work
here, and then spend the remainder of
their lives telling us of their passionate
determination to get away back to the
old folks?</p>

<p>And would I be right in my surmise
that very few homes in Wigan have
roses round the door or stand in fields
of growing cotton and corn or reek of
new-mown hay?</p>

<p>And why is it that, when you tell a
man there are so many million stars in
the skies, he will believe you, but the
moment he sees a notice on a gate
bearing the words "Wet Paint" he
puts his finger upon it just to find out
for himself?</p>

<p>And why did Mrs. <span class="sc">Asquith</span>&mdash;&mdash;But
perhaps that will be enough for the
Professor to be going on with.</p>

<h3>Christmas and the Children.</h3>

<p>With the approach of a Festival that is dedicated to the
joy of children, Mr. Punch makes bold to plead the cause
of the less fortunate among them. The Queen's Hospital
for Children, once known as the North-Eastern Hospital
for Children, is the only one of its kind in this part of
London and serves a poor district with a population of half-a-million.
Its claim upon the generosity of more favoured
Londoners is as strong as its lack of funds at the present
moment is serious. It has one hundred-and-seventy beds,
and during the last year has cared for eighteen hundred
in-patients and sixty thousand out-patients. Mr. Punch is
certain that, if the children of the West-end understood the
suffering and needs of these other children of Bethnal Green,
they would want to help them by forgoing some of their
Christmas toys. Gifts should be addressed to the Secretary,
T. <span class="sc">Glenton-Kerr</span>, Esq., Queen's Hospital for Children,
Hackney Road, Bethnal Green, E.2.</p>

<h3>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h3>

<p><i>Monday, November 29th.</i>&mdash;Some time
ago Lord <span class="sc">Newton</span> was appointed Chairman
of a Committee on Smoke Abatement.
It took enough evidence to fill
a Blue-book a couple of inches thick,
and, at the request of the Government,
furnished an interim report. Supposing,
not unnaturally, that its valuable recommendations
would be adopted in the Government's
housing schemes the Committee
was disgusted to find that, save
for an emasculated summary in "a dismal
journal called <i>Housing</i>," no notice
was taken of its report. Lord <span class="sc">Newton</span> is
not a man who can safely be invited to
consume his own smoke, and he made
indignant protest this afternoon. A
soft answer from Lord <span class="sc">Sandhurst</span>, who
assured him that the Government, far
from being unmindful of the Committee's
labours, had already equipped some
thousands of houses with central heating,
temporarily diverted his wrath.</p>

<p>Thanks to the Sinn Feiners, the
Public Galleries of the House of Commons
were closed. Thus deprived of all
audience save themselves and the reporters
the most loquacious Members
were depressed. <i>Bombinantes in gurgite
vasto</i>, their arguments sounded
hollow even to themselves. With an
obvious effort they tried to carry on
what the <span class="sc">Speaker</span> described&mdash;and deprecated&mdash;as
"the usual Monday fiscal
debate." This time it turned upon the
large imports from Russia in 1913.
One side seemed to think that similar
imports would be forthcoming to-day
but for the obstructiveness of the
British Government, while the other
was confident that Russia had nothing
to export save propaganda. The controversy
was beginning to pall when
by a happy inspiration Mr. <span class="sc">Ronald
McNeill</span>, with mock solemnity, inquired
if the last egg in Russia had not
been eaten by a relation of the <span class="sc">Secretary
of State for War.</span></p>

<p>"His conscience now quite clear."</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sir J. T. Agg-Gardner.</span></p>
</div>

<p>A long-standing Parliamentary tradition
enjoins that the reply to any Question
addressed to the <span class="sc">Chairman of the
Kitchen Committee</span> should be greeted
with laughter. By virtue of his office
he holds, as it were, the "pass-the-mustard"
prerogative. Members laughed
accordingly when he replied to a question
relating to the number of ex-Service
men employed by his Committee; but
they laughed much more loudly when
the hon. Member who put the original
Question proceeded to inquire "if his
conscience is now quite clear," and
Sir J. T. <span class="sc">Agg-Gardner</span>, looking as respectable
as if he were <i>Mrs. Grundy's</i>
second husband, declared, hand on heart,
that it was.</p>

<p>THE DEFENDER OF KUT&mdash;WITH ESCORT.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sir Charles Townshend</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>The House gave a rather less stentorian
welcome than might have been
expected to Sir <span class="sc">Charles Townshend</span>,
who was escorted up to the Table by
Mr. <span class="sc">Bottomley</span> and Colonel <span class="sc">Croft</span>.
Perhaps it was afraid that cheers
intended for the defender of Kut might
be appropriated by the Editor of <i>John
Bull</i>.</p>

<p>Encouraged, I suppose, by the emptiness
of the Ladies' Gallery, it then proceeded
with great freedom to discuss a
proposal for the employment of women
and young persons "in shifts."</p>

<p>THE FAT BOY OF DULWICH.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sir Frederick Hall.</span></p>
</div>

<p><i>Tuesday, November 30th.</i>&mdash;The <span class="sc">ex-Crown
Prince of Prussia</span> will be tremendously
bucked when he reads the
report of to-day's proceedings, and discovers
that there is one person in the
world who takes him seriously. Sir
<span class="sc">Frederick Hall</span> has been much disturbed
by the reports of Hohenzollern
intrigues for a restoration, and begged
the Government to send a protest to
the Dutch Government. But the Fat
Boy of Dulwich quite failed to make
Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar Law's</span> flesh creep.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Baldwin</span> is the least perturbable
of Ministers. Even when Major
<span class="sc">Edwards</span> invited him to elucidate the
phrase "a working knowledge of the
Welsh language"&mdash;"Does it mean having
an intimate acquaintance with the
literary works of <span class="sc">Dafydd Ap Gwilym</span>
or the forgeries of 'Iolo Morganwg'?"&mdash;he
never turned a hair.</p>

<p>Modesty not having hitherto been
regarded as one of Mr. <span class="sc">Churchill's</span>
most salient characteristics I feel it
my duty to record that, on being asked
when he would introduce the Supplementary
Army Estimates, he replied,
"I am entirely in the hands of my
superiors."</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, December 1st.</i>&mdash;That
Hebrew should be one of the official
languages of Palestine seems, on the
face of it, not unreasonable. But,
according to Lord <span class="sc">Treowen</span>, to compel
the average Palestinian Jew, who speaks
either Spanish or Yiddish, to use classical
Hebrew, will be like obliging a
user of pidgin English to adopt the
language of <span class="sc">Addison</span>. He failed, however,
to make any impression upon
Lord <span class="sc">Crawford</span>, who expressed the
hope that the Government's action
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page454" id="page454"></a>[pg 454]</span>
would help to purify the language.
Sir <span class="sc">Herbert Samuel</span> is determined, I
gather, to make Palestine a country fit
for rabbis to live in.</p>

<p>The Government of Ireland Bill had
a very rough time in Committee. The
<span class="sc">Lord Chancellor</span> managed to ward
off Lord <span class="sc">Midleton</span>'s proposal to have
one Parliament instead of two&mdash;"a
blow at the heart of the Bill"&mdash;but
was less successful when Lord <span class="sc">Oranmore
and Browne</span> moved that the
Southern Parliament should be furnished
with a Senate. The Peers'
natural sentiment in favour of Second
Chambers triumphed, and the Government
were defeated by a big majority.</p>

<p>The Office of Works has been lending
a hand to local authorities in difficulties
with their housing schemes. But when
Sir <span class="sc">Alfred Mond</span> brought up a Supplementary
Estimate in respect of these
transactions he met with a storm of
indignation that surprised him. "The
road to bankruptcy," "Nationalisation
in the building trade," "Socialistic proposals"&mdash;these
were some of the phrases
that assailed his ears. Fortified, however,
by the support of the Labour Party&mdash;Mr.
<span class="sc">Myers</span> declared that his action
had been "the one bright spot in the
whole of the housing policy"&mdash;Sir
<span class="sc">Alfred</span> challenged his critics to go
and tell their constituents that they
had voted to prevent houses being
built, and got his Estimate through by
190 to 64.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, December 2nd</i>.&mdash;Thanks
to the free-and-easy procedure of the
House of Lords the Government began
the day with a victory. Lord <span class="sc">Shandon</span>
had moved an amendment, to which the
<span class="sc">Lord Chancellor</span> objected. But he
did not challenge a division when the
question was put. Lord <span class="sc">Donoughmore</span>,
most expeditious of Chairmen, announced
"the Contents have it," and
the matter seemed over. But then the
<span class="sc">Lord Chancellor</span> woke up, and said
he had meant to ask for a division.
"All right," said the <span class="sc">Chairman</span>; "clear
the Bar," and when the white-wanded
tellers had counted their flocks it appeared
that the Government had a
majority of three.</p>

<p>I do not suppose anyone will say of
Lord <span class="sc">Birkenhead</span>, as a celebrated
judge is reported to have said of one of
his predecessors, "'Ere comes that 'oly
'umbug 'umming 'is 'orrid 'ymns;" but
he is evidently a student of hymnology,
for he referred to the Government victory
as this "scanty triumph" and for
a long time did not challenge any more
divisions.</p>

<p>In the House of Commons an attack
upon the new liquor regulations&mdash;"pieces
of gross impertinence" according
to Mr. <span class="sc">Macquisten</span>&mdash;found no
favour with the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span>. Mr.
<span class="sc">McCurdy</span> announced that he had reduced
the price of wheat to the millers
and hoped that "in a few weeks" the
consumer might begin to receive the
benefit. The <span class="sc">Chancellor of the Exchequer</span>
excused the delay in publishing
the Economy Committee's reports on
the ground that the <span class="sc">Minister of Munitions</span>
was "at sea," and elicited the
inevitable gibe that he was not the
only one. Sir <span class="sc">Eric Geddes</span>, with a
judicious compliment to the motorists
for setting "an extraordinary example
of voluntary taxation," got a Second
Reading for his Roads Bill; and Sir
<span class="sc">Gordon Hewart</span> with some difficulty
induced the House to accept his assurance
that the Official Secrets Bill was
meant for the discomfiture of spies and
not the harassing of honest journalists.</p>

<h3>TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGONE.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;You are fond, in
"Charivaria," of poking some of your
gentle fun at the leisurely bricklayer,
and indeed at all the "ca-canny" brigade;
but the bricklayer has come in
for the thickest of your fire. I hope,
however, that you don't think you have
discovered his and his fellow-workers'
deliberate processes yourself. If so,
permit me to draw your attention to
<span class="sc">Ned Ward's</span> <i>London Spy</i>, which was
published as long ago as 1699. In that
work is the description of a visit to St.
Paul's Cathedral when it was building.
A passage in this description runs thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>
"We went a little further, where we
observed ten men in a corner very busie
about two men's work, taking so much
care that everyone should have his due
proportion of the labours as so many
thieves in making an exact division of
their booty. The wonderful piece of
difficulty the whole number had to perform
was to drag along a stone of about
three hundredweight in a carriage, in
order to be hoisted upon the moldings
of the cupola, but they were so fearful
of despatching this facile undertaking
with too much expedition that they
were longer in hauling about half the
length of the church than a couple of
lusty porters, I am certain, would have
been carrying it to Paddington without
resting of their burthen."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Shall I refrain from remarking that
there is nothing new under the sun?
I will.</p>

<h3>AT THE PLAY.</h3>

<h4>"<span class="sc1">The Dragon</span>."</h4>

<p>Some day, no doubt, plays like <i>Mr.
Wu</i> and <i>The Dragon</i> (by <span class="sc">R. E. Jeffrey</span>)
will be forbidden by the League of
Nations. Meanwhile let us allow ourselves
to be diverted by the motiveless
villainies of crooked cruel "Chinks"
like <i>Wang Fu Chang</i>, who sold opium
at a terrific profit in Mayfair, hung his
servants up by their thumbs and belonged
to a Society of Elder Brethren,
as to whose activities we were given
no clue, unless indeed their job was
the kidnapping of Younger Sisters for
Wicked Mandarins.</p>

<p>For <i>Jack Stacey</i>, who opened the
Prologue in Loolong with head in hands
and moaned invocations of the Deity
(a version doubtless of the well-known
gambit, "'Hell!' said the Duchess"),
had his little daughter kidnapped at
birth or thereabouts (by <i>Wang Fu</i>, as it
happened), and never saw her again till,
after eighteen years of opium-doping&mdash;between
the Prologue and the First Act&mdash;he
called upon the same <i>Wang Fu</i> (just
before dinner) with a peremptory message
from a very bad and powerful
mandarin that if little Miss <i>Che Fu</i>
were not packed off to China by eleven
that same evening the Elder Brethren
would be one short by midnight. <i>Che
Fu</i>, I ought to say, passed as <i>Wang's</i>
daughter, but was so English, you know,
to look at that nobody could really believe
it.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<a href="images/456.png"><img src="images/456-250.png" width="250" height="333" alt="THE MODEL FLAPPER" /></a>
<p>THE MODEL FLAPPER (<span class="sc">Chinese style</span>).</p>
<p><i>Wang Fu Chang</i><span class="sc">Mr. D.L. Mannering</span>.</p>
<p><i>Che Fu</i><span class="sc">Miss Christine Silver</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>Of course <i>Jack</i> didn't recognise her as
his own daughter, but equally of course
we did, and knew that she would be
rescued by her impetuous boy-lover and
restored to her real father; but not
before great business with opium pipes,
pivoting statues of goddesses, inoperative
revolvers, gongs, strangulations
(with gurgles), detectives, rows of
Chinese servants each more rascally
(and less Chinese, if possible) than the
last, and over all the polished villainy
of the inscrutable <i>Wang Fu Chang</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Jeffrey's</span> technique was quite
adequate for this ingenuous kind of
thing. He achieved what I take to be
the supreme compliment of noisy hushings
sibilated from the pit and gallery
when the later curtains rose. Perhaps
action halted a little to allow of rather
too much display of pidgin-English
and (I suppose) authentic elementary
Chinese and comic reliefs which filled the
spaces between the salient episodes of
the slender and naïve plot. I couldn't
help wondering how <i>Jack Stacey</i>, whom
we left at 10.45 in a horrible stupor, shut
away in a gilded alcove of <i>Wang Fu's</i>
opium den, could appear at 11.30 at
<i>Lady Handley's</i> in immaculate evening
dress and with entirely unruffled hair,
having in the meantime cut down and
restored to consciousness two tortured
Chinese and heard the true story of his
daughter's adventures. This seems to
be overdoing the unities. And I wondered
whether the puzzled look on
young <i>Handley's</i> face was due to this
same wonder or to the reflection that
if he had shed one undesirable father-in-law
he had let himself in for another.
For, needless to say, they had all met
in the famous opium scene when <i>Stacey</i>
was naturally not at his best.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">D. Lewin Mannering</span> was suitably
sinister as <i>Wang Fu</i>; Mr. <span class="sc">Tarver
Penna's</span> <i>Ah Fong</i>, the heroine's champion,
made some very pleasant faces and
gestures and was less incurably Western
than some of his colleagues; Mr. <span class="sc">Cronin
Wilson's</span> <i>Jack Stacey</i> seemed a meritorious
performance. The part of <i>Che
Fu</i> made no particular demand on Miss
<span class="sc">Christine Silver's</span> talent, and Miss
<span class="sc">Evadne Price</span> faithfully earned the
laughter she was expected to make as
<i>Sua Se</i>, the opium-den attendant. Leave
your critical faculty at home and you
will be able to derive considerable entertainment
from this unambitious
show.</p>

<h3>THE BARREL OF BEEF.</h3>

<p>We were dawdling home from the
westward on the flood. Astern of us,
knee-deep in foam, stood the slim
column of the Bishop lighthouse, a
dark pencil mark on the cloudless sky.
To the south the full Atlantic piled the
black reefs with hills of snow. Ahead
the main islands humped out of the
blue sea like a school of basking whales.
I had the tiller and Uncle Billy John
Polsue was forward picking up the
marks and carrying on a running commentary,
punctuated by expectorations
of dark fluid. Suddenly something
away on the port bow attracted his
attention. He rolled to his feet, stared
for some seconds and shouted, "Hold
'er on the corner o' Great Minalte!"
a tremor of excitement in his voice.</p>

<p>I did as I was bid and sheeted home.</p>

<p>Billy John fished the conger gaff
from under the blue and silver heap of
mackerel in the well and climbed laboriously
on to the little half-deck. So
we were after some sort of flotsam, I
could not see what, because Billy John's
expansive back-view obscured the prospect
ahead, but from his tense attitude
I judged that it appeared interesting.
He signed to me to come up another
couple of points, took a firm grasp of
the gaff and leaned over the bows.
Then with a creak of straining tackle
and a hiss of riven water a gig was on
us. She swooped out of the blue,
swept by not two fathoms to windward
and with a boat-hook snapped up
the treasure trove (it looked suspiciously
like a small keg) right under our very
noses as adroitly as a lurcher snaps a
hare. She ran on a cable's length,
spun on her heel and slipped away
down the sound, a long lean craft,
leaping like a live thing under her press
of canvas. She seemed full of redheaded
men of all ages and was steered
by a brindled patriarch who wagged
his vermilion beard at us and cackled
loudly. I roared with laughter; I had
seldom seen anything so consummately
slick in my life.</p>

<p>Billy John roared too, but from other
influences. He bellowed, he spat, he
danced with rage. He cursed the gig's
company collectively and singly, said
they were nothing better than common
pirates and that they lured ships to destruction
and devoured the crews&mdash;raw.</p>

<p>The gig's company were delighted;
they jeered and waved their caps. Billy
John trembled with passion.</p>

<p>"Who stole the bar'l o' beef?" he
trumpeted through his palms. "Who&mdash;stole&mdash;the&mdash;bar'l&mdash;o'&mdash;beef?
Hoo hoo!"</p>

<p>This last sally had a subduing effect
on the gig's company; they turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page457" id="page457"></a>[pg 457]</span>
their faces away and became absorbed
in the view ahead.</p>

<p>Billy John sat down with a grunt of
satisfaction. "That settled 'em," he
grinned. "They dunno who did steal
the bar'l to this day, and each wan do
suspect t'other."</p>

<p>"St. Martin's islanders?" I queried.</p>

<p>Billy John shook his head. "Naw,
from St. Helen's, o' course; deddn' you
see their red 'eads? They 're all red-'eaded
over on Helen's&mdash;take after their
great-grandfather the Devil."</p>

<p>"They're pretty smart, anyhow,"
said I.</p>

<p>Billy John threw up both hands.
"Smart! By dang you've said it! Anythin'
in the way o' honest work they
do leave to us poor mainland grabbers;
they don't unnerstand it; but come a
bit o' easy money in the way of wreckage
and we might as well stop bed as
try to compete with they; we eddn but
children to 'em."</p>

<p>"What about this barrel of beef?" I
asked.</p>

<p>Billy John chuckled. "Comed to pass
years ago, Sir. There was a party of
us over 'ere crabbin'. My brother
Zackariah 'ad married a Helen's wumman,
and a brear great piece she were
too. They was livin' on Helen's upon
Lower Town beach, and we lodged with
'em.</p>

<p>"Wan mornin' before dawn along
comes great Susan in her stockined feet.
'Whist!' says she, 'rouse thee out an'
don't make no noise; I think I heerd
a gun from Carnebiggal Ledges.'</p>

<p>"We sneaked out like shadows, got
the boat afloat and pulled away, mufflin'
the oars with our caps. We got a fair
start; nobody heerd us go. It weren't
yet light and the fog were like a bag,
but we got there somehow, and sure
enough there were a big steamer fast
on the rocks. Great Susan were right.
Oh, I tell you t'eddn guesswork with
they St. Helen's folk; male or female
they got a nose for a wreck, same as
cats for mice. There was a couple o'
ship's boats standing by on her port
side full o' men.</p>

<p>"'Where in 'ell are we?' shouts 'er
skipper as we comed nosing through
the fog. 'I ain't seen the sun for two
days.'</p>

<p>"We told en and lay by chattin' and
wonderin' 'ow we was to plunder she,
with them in the road. Time went by
and there we was still chattin' about
the weather an' suchlike damfoolery.
Every minute I was expectin' to see
the Helen's gigs swarmin' out, and then
it wouldn't be pickin's we'd get but
leavin's.</p>

<p>"''Ere,' whispers I to Zakky, 'scare
'im off for God's sake.'</p>

<p>"'I'll 'ave a try,' says 'e. 'Say,
Mr. Captain, the tide's makin'. She
do come through 'ere like a river and
you'll be swamped for certain. Pull
for the shore, sailor.'</p>

<p>"'Will you pilot me in?' says the
captain.</p>

<p>"'Naw,' says Zakky. 'I got to be
after my crab-pots; but I'll send my
nephew wid 'e.'</p>

<p>"'Keep 'em lost out in the Sound for
a couple of hours, son,' he whispers to
the boy, and the lad takes 'em off into
the fog. 'Now for the plunder, my
dears,' says Zakky; and we makes for
the ship.</p>

<p>"But Lor' bless you, Sir, she were
already plundered. While we was
chattin' away on her port side four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page458" id="page458"></a>[pg 458]</span>
Helen's gigs' crews had boarded her
quietly from starboard and was eatin'
through her like a pest o' ants. They'd
come staggering on deck&mdash;fathers, sons
and grandfathers&mdash;with bundles twice
as big nor themselves, toss 'em into the
gigs and go back for more. As for us,
we stood like men mazed. I tell you,
Sir, a God-fearing man can't make a
livin' 'mong that lot; they'll turn a
vessel inside out while he's thinkin'
how to begin.</p>

<p>"By-'m-by they comed on the prize o'
the lot&mdash;a bar'l o' beef. My word, what
an outcry! 'I seed 'en first!' 'Naw,
you deddn': hands off!' 'Leggo;
's mine!' Quarrellin' 'mong themselves
now, mark you, beef bein' as
scarce as diamonds in them hard times.
Old Hosea&mdash;the old toad that you seed
steerin' that gig just now&mdash;he puts a
stop to et.</p>

<p>"'Avast ragin', thou fools,' says 'e;
"coastguards will be along in a minute
and then there'll be nothin' for nobody.
Set en in my boat an' I'll divide it up
equal on the beach.'</p>

<p>"They done as they were told, and
away goes old Hosea for the shore, followed
by the other gigs loaded that
deep they could hardly swim. Seein'
they hadn't left us nothin' but the bare
bones we pulled in ourselves shortly
after, and my dear life what a sight we
did behold! Fellows runnin' about in
the fog on the beach, for all the world
like shadows on a blind, cursin', shoutin',
fightin', tumblin' over each other,
huntin' high and low, and in the middle
of 'em all old Hosea crying out for
his bar'l o' beef like a wumman after
her first-born. Somebody'd stole it!
Mercy me! we mainlanders lay on our
oars and laughed till the tears rolled
out of us in streams."</p>

<p>"Who did steal it? Do you know?"
I asked.</p>

<p>Billy John nodded. "I do, Sir. Why,
great Susan, o' course. They'd forgotten
she, livin' right upon the beach&mdash;wan
o' their own breed. Susan stalked en
through the fog an' had en locked in
her own house before they could turn
round. And many a full meal we poor
honest mainlanders had off it, Sir, take
it from me."</p>

<h3>EFFECT AND CAUSE.</h3>

<p>The bell was knelling: dong, dong,
dong, dong, dong, dong, dong, dong.</p>

<p>Inside the Hall there was nothing
but gloom.</p>

<p>Suddenly the echoes were startled by
a loud knocking on the door: rat, tat,

<p>Who could it be?</p>

<p>The old servitor shambled to undo
the bolts. As he opened the door the
wind rushed in, carrying great flakes of
snow with it and an icy blast penetrated
to every corner of the house.</p>

<p>There followed a man muffled up to
the eyes in a vast red scarf&mdash;or not so
much red as pink, salmon colour&mdash;which
he proceeded gradually to unwind, revealing
at length the features of Mr.
James Tod Brown, the senior partner
of the firm of Brown, Brown &amp; Brown,
of Little Britain. Save for a curious
nervousness of speech which caused
him to repeat every remark several
times, Mr. James Tod Brown was a
typical lawyer, in the matter of ability
far in advance of either of his partners,
Brown or Brown.</p>

<p>"Dear me," he said, "dear me, dear
me! This is very sad, very sad&mdash;very
sudden too, very sudden. And what&mdash;tut,

as it may appear; there is method in
the madness; for this is a passage from
a story by one of the most popular
English authors in America, to whom
an American editor has offered twenty
cents a word. At the present rate of
exchange such commissions are not to
be trifled with.</p>

<h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. Joseph Hergesheimer</span>, for whose work as a novelist
I have more than once expressed high admiration, has
now brought together seven long-short stories under the
collective title of <i>The Happy End</i> (<span class="sc">Heinemann</span>). Lest
however this name and the little preface, in which the
writer asserts that his wares "have but one purpose&mdash;to
give pleasure," should lead you to expect that species of
happy ending in which Jack shall have Jill and naught
shall go ill, I think a word of warning may not be wasted.
In only three of the tales is the finish a matter of conventional
happiness. Elsewhere you have a deserted husband,
who has tracked his betrayer to a nigger saloon in Atlantic
City, wrested from his purpose of murder by a revivalist
hymn; a young lad, having avenged the destruction of his
home, returning to his widowed mother to await, one supposes,
the process of the law; or an over-fed war profiteer
stricken with apoplexy at sight of a boat full of the starved
victims of a submarine outrage. You observe perhaps that
the epithet "happy" is one to which the artist and the casual
reader may attach a different significance. But let not anything
I have said be considered as reflecting upon the tales
themselves, which indeed seem to me to be masterpieces
of their kind. Personally my choice would rest on the
last, "The Thrush in the Hedge," a simple history of how
the voice of a young tramp was revealed by his chance
meeting with a blind and drug-sodden fiddler who had once
played in opera&mdash;a thing of such unforced art that its concluding
pages, when the discovery is put to a final test,
shake the mind with apprehension and hope. A writer who
can make a short story do that comes near to genius.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you wish to play the now fashionable game of
newspaper-proprietor-baiting you can, with Miss <span class="sc">Rose Macaulay</span>,
create a possible but not actual figure like <i>Potter</i> and, using
it for stalking-horse, duly point your moral; or, with Mr.
<span class="sc">W. L. George</span> in <i>Caliban</i> (<span class="sc">Methuen</span>), you can begin
by
mentioning all the well-known figures in the journalistic
world by way of easy camouflage, so as to evade the law
of libel, call your hero-villain <i>Bulmer</i>, attach to him all the
legends about actual newspaper kings, add some malicious
distortion to make them more exciting and impossible, and
thoroughly let yourself go. Good taste alone will decide which
is the cleaner sport, and good taste does not happen to be
the fashion in certain literary circles at the moment. Of
course Mr. <span class="sc">George</span>, being a novelist of some skill, has provided
a background out of his imagination. The most
interesting episode, excellently conceived and worked out,
is the only unsuccessful passage in <i>Lord Bulmer's</i> life, the
wooing of <i>Janet Willoughby</i>. The awkward thing for Mr.
<span class="sc">George</span> is that he has so splashed the yellow over <i>Bulmer</i>
in the office that there is no use in his pretending that the
<i>Bulmer</i> in <i>Mrs. Willoughby's</i> drawing-room is the same
man in another mood. He just isn't. Incidentally the author
gives us the best defence of the saffron school of journalism
I've read&mdash;a defence that's a little too good to believe; and
some shrewd blows above (and, as I have hinted, occasionally
below) the belt.</p>

<hr />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page460" id="page460"></a>[pg 460]</span>

<p>I want to give the epithet "lush" to <i>The Breathless
Moment</i> (<span class="sc">Lane</span>), and, although the dictionary asks me as
far as in me lies to reserve that adjective for grass, I really
don't see why, just for once, I shouldn't do what I like
with it. Lush grass is generally long and brightly coloured&mdash;"luxuriant
and succulent," the dictionary says&mdash;and that
is exactly what <span class="sc">Miss Muriel Hine's</span> book is. She tells
the story of <i>Sabine Fane</i>, who, loving <i>Mark Vallance</i>,
persuaded
him to pass a honeymoon month with her before he
went to the Front, though his undesirable wife was still
alive. In allowing her heroine to suffer the penalty of this
action Miss <span class="sc">Hine</span> would appear, as far as plot is concerned,
to discourage such adventures. But <i>Sabine</i> is so charming,
her troubles end so happily and the setting of West
Country scenery is so beautiful that, taken as a whole, I
should expect the book to have the opposite effect. The
picture of a tall green wave propelling
a very solid rainbow,
which adorns the paper wrapper
and as an advertisement
has cheered travellers on the
Tube for some weeks past, has
no real connection with the
story, but perhaps is meant
to be symbolical of the book,
which, clever and well written
as it is, is almost as little like
what happens in real life.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>The Uses of Diversity</i> (<span class="sc">Methuen</span>)
is the title of a little
volume in which Mr. <span class="sc">G. K.
Chesterton</span> has reprinted a
selection of his shorter essays,
fugitive pieces of journalism,
over which indeed the casual
reader may experience some
natural bewilderment at finding,
what is inevitable in such
work, the trivialities of the day
before yesterday treated with
the respect of contemporary
regard. Many of the papers are
inspired by the appearance of a
particular book or play. I can
best illustrate what I have said
above by a quotation from
one of them, in which the
author wrote (<i>à propos</i> of the silver goblets in <i>Henry VIII</i>.
at His Majesty's) that he supposed such realism might be
extended to include "a real Jew to act <i>Shylock</i>." For those
who recall a recent triumph, this flight of imagination will
now have an oddly archaic effect. It is by no means the only
passage to remind us sharply that much canvas has gone
over the stage rollers since these appreciations were written.
Unquestionably Mr. <span class="sc">Chesterton</span>, with the unstaled entertainment
of his verbal acrobatics, stands the ordeal of such
revival better than most. Even when he is upon a theme
so outworn as the "Pageants that have adorned England
of late," he can always astonish with some grave paradox.
But for all that I still doubt whether journalism so much
of the moment as this had not more fitly been left for the
pleasure of casual rediscovery in its original home than
served up with the slightly overweighting dignity of even
so small a volume.</p>

<hr />

<p>In <i>A Tale That Is Told</i> (<span class="sc">Collins</span>), Mr. <span class="sc">Frederick
Niven</span>
throws himself into the personality of <i>Harold Grey</i>, who
is the youngest son of an "eminent Scottish divine," and
constitutes himself the annalist of the family, its private
affairs and its professional business in the commerce of
literature and art. The right of the family to its annals,
notwithstanding that its members are little involved in
furious adventures or thrilling romance, is established at
once by the very remarkable character of the <i>Reverend
Thomas Grey</i>. The duty upon you to read them depends,
as the prologue hints, upon whether you are greatly
interested in life and not exclusively intent on fiction.
When I realised that I must expect no more than an
account, without climax, of years spent as a tale that is
told, I accepted the conditions subject to certain terms of
my own. The family must be an interesting one and not
too ordinary; the sons, <i>Thomas</i> (whose creed was "Give
yourself," and whose application of it was such that it
usually wrecked the person to whom the gift was made),
<i>Dick</i> the artist, and <i>John</i> the
novelist, must be very much
alive; if the big adventures
were missing the little problems
must be faced; the question
of sex must not be overlooked;
and of humour none
of the characters must be devoid,
and the historian himself
must be full. Mr. <span class="sc">Niven</span> failed
me in no particular.</p>

<hr />

<p>Miss <span class="sc">F. E. Mills Young</span>,
in <i>Imprudence</i> (<span class="sc">Hodder and
Stoughton</span>), is not at the top
of her form, but a neat and
effective finish makes some
amends for a performance
which is, like the wind in a
weather report, mainly moderate
or light. The heroine, <i>Prudence
Graynor</i>, was the child of
her father's second marriage,
and she was afflicted with a
battalion of elderly half-sisters
and one quite detestable half-brother.
This battalion was
commanded by one <i>Agatha</i>, and
it submitted to her orders and
caprices in a way incomprehensible
to <i>Prudence</i>&mdash;and incidentally
to me. The <i>Graynors</i>
and also the <i>Morgans</i> were of "influential commercial stock,"
and both families were so essentially Victorian in their outlook
and manner of living that I was surprised when 1914
was announced. The trouble with this story is that too
many of the characters are drawn from the stock-pot. But
I admit that, before we have done with them, they acquire
a certain distinction from the adroitness with which the
author extricates them from apparently hopeless situations.</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
